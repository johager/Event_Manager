# Event Manager

This is the third self-assessment project for the Devmountain iOS App Developer Bootcamp.

The app tracks a set of events that have a name, date, and flag for isAttending. Events are added and edited through an event detail view.

The data is persisted using CoreData.

Additions to the baseline project:

- The eventCell includes the event date.
- The events list can be sorted by name or date.
- User notifications can be sent at the time of the event, an hour before, a day before, and/or a week before.
